My development environment is based on windows desktop using VSCode as editor with a collections of extension and CSpect for ZX Spectrum Next Emulation and also ZX Spectrum Next hardware.

## VSCode Extensions ##

VSCode is the beating heart of my coding world, supercharged by countless plugins that make every development task smoother and more powerful.

I supercharge VSCode with a curated set of extensions that elevate Z80 assembly development to the same power and convenience as modern languages like C.

**ASM Code Lens** A language server that enables code lens, references, hover information, symbol renaming and the outline view for assembler files.
