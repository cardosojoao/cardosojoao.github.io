## VSCode Extensions ##

VSCode is the beating heart of my coding world, supercharged by countless plugins that make every development task smoother and more powerful.

I supercharge VSCode with a curated set of extensions that elevate Z80 assembly development to the same power and convenience as modern languages like C.

**ASM Code Lens** A language server that enables code lens, references, hover information, symbol renaming and the outline view for assembler files.

---

**DeZog** is a powerful Z80 debugger plugin for VSCode, offering advanced tools to make Spectrum Next development efficient and precise.

My favourite extension makes debugging easier and more powerful than ever—it’s like a Swiss Army knife for developers.
